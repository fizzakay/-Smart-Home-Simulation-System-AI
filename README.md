# Smart-Energy Optimizer

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Smart-Energy Optimizer is an AI-powered enhancement to a smart home system that learns user behavior and adjusts lighting and thermostat settings to minimize energy usage while maximizing comfort. It automates energy savings based on patterns in user activity.

## Background

Many people leave devices on unnecessarily or fail to optimize their energy consumption habits. This leads to higher utility bills and environmental harm. The project aims to address this by using AI to automate energy-saving decisions.

**Problems solved:**

* Wasted energy due to manual control
* No real-time behavior-based adjustment
* Lack of visibility into energy consumption habits

## How is it used?

The system starts by collecting simulated user interaction dataâ€”such as when users turn on lights or change temperature. As data accumulates, the AI predicts future patterns and makes automatic adjustments.

**Used in:**

* Smart homes
* Eco-conscious households
* Environments requiring automated comfort control

**User benefits:**

* Automatic adjustment of devices
* Visual feedback and manual override options
* Real-time energy saving

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data sources:**

* Simulated smart home usage logs
* Optional temperature APIs
* User-preferred settings

**AI techniques:**

* Time-series pattern recognition
* Supervised learning (e.g., Decision Trees)
* Reinforcement learning for adaptive tuning

**Tools:**

* Python
* Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
* Pandas, Matplotlib

## Challenges

* Cold-start problem (no data in the beginning)
* No sensor feedback for windows or external factors
* Ethical concerns over automated control
* May need customization for different users

## What next?

* Add real-time weather API integration
* Develop voice and mobile control interfaces
* Deploy on Raspberry Pi or smart home hub
* Build dashboard for real-time energy tracking

## Acknowledgments
